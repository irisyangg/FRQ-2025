**Dog Walker:**
The question involved of structure and using proper parameters and calling correct methods. Everything is quite built on top of another and any small mismatch will mess up the total overall code. 

**My initial approach during the exam:**
I got overwhelmed over the amount of texts I had to read and spent majority of the time trying to figure out what I was supposed to do rather than coding itself. I honestly just tried what I thought I knew, the loops, and saved it for when I have extra time at the end. 

**My revised solution after review:**
I would honestly just skim through rather than focusing on unnecessary details so I'm less confused and save more time for actual coding. 
Looking back, the code itself really as complicated as the question itself, mainly loops with correct parameters, some calculations, and most importantly calling above methods. 

**Key concepts tested in this question:**
- Accessing elements through a list
- Proper parameter types
- Loops and simple calcualtions 
- calling other methods

**What I learned from revisiting this problem:**
I learned a lot more about loops and just how important the correct input is for a program to run, especially for more realistic problems. If I accessed the hours wrong then every other mess will follow, same with not calling the non-implemented methods.
