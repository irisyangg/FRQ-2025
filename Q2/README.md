**Signature Class:**
The question involved of strings and conditionals and concatentation. The behaviors depend on what what's already given and you can only add so much. 

**My initial approach during the exam:**
The initial components weren't that bad but it was just the last section that was a little bit confusing with the examples. It didn't click that fast which means I lost a lot of time, but rest was pretty straight forward. 

**My revised solution after review:**
I'm not sure why it didn't click for a while, but if it did I would've rushed less and the code would probably be more efficient. Part B was mainly conditionals, using (well, what I used at least) indexOf to locate if a signature is already there, and where to add if located incorrectly. 

**Key concepts tested in this question:**
- String manipulation
- Concatentation 
- Conditionals
- Locating (characters/words/signature)

**What I learned from revisiting this problem:**
I learned a lot more about conditionals and how to access different constructions of strings. I haven't used indexOf in a while too, so this refreshed that memory as well.
