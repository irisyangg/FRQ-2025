**Competition/Competitor:**
The question involved of ArrayLists and using loops to access data. The controls and array manipulations were needed to correctly pair up different competitors so accessing each element correctly is a huge part of this question.

**My initial approach during the exam:**
I struggled mainly on how to add proper competitors into the ArrayList as I never thought to put it inside a loop. In my mind the number was just fixated on 2 and was the root of most of my confusion. 

**My revised solution after review:**
After the help of peers, I learned that it was a really smart idea to put the 2 paired competitors inside a loop so that way it fixes itself. I also didn't think of accessing them in the list through their start/end plus/minus their index, which was a genius move. This was such a better and more efficient way that I could've never came up with on my own. 

**Key concepts tested in this question:**
- Accessing elements through an ArrayList
- MOD, for even and or length lists
- Using correct indexes
- Initalizing ArrayList

**What I learned from revisiting this problem:**
I learned so much from revisiting this problem, the most compared to other ones. Although I've mentioned above, the using start/end plus/minus their index was just such a great idea that I'm mad I couldn't think of. Along the lines of that, the putting the 2 competitors inside a loop was also so much more efficient. These ideas are found in many other questions I believe, and it will help in the long run.
