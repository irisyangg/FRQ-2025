**Puzzle Game:**
The question involved of 2D arrays and accessing/comparing elements correctly. It also focused on conditionals and the element's surroundings, which is similar to Game of Life that we did in class. 

**My initial approach during the exam:** 
I remembered it was quite similar to something taught in class but I'm not too sure if I ever got the time to fully finish this question. I wrote down what I remember, which was the nested loops, and I remember vaguely planning out the code. 

**My revised solution after review:** 
Game of Life was really helpful for this to be honest, and accessing the elements wasn't too bad as long as you had loops and the rows/columns. The rest really is the conditionals like the and's/or's. 

**Key concepts tested in this question:**

- Accessing elements through a 2D ArrayList
- Conditionals 
- Boundaries
- Math.random
- Booleans 
  
**What I learned from revisiting this problem:**
The Math.random was pretty refreshing to learn again, same with the or statement. The nested loops with puzzle length and puzzle[0] length for accessing every element is also a pretty big concept that I believe will be needed in the future, so learning this now will be really useful.
