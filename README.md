# AP CSA FRQ 2025 SOLUTIONS 
**Solutions written by Iris Yang**

# Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on May 7th, 2025. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

# Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam.

My preparation strategy for the exam included: 
- Knowt
- Quizlet
- Princeton Review Book
- previous College Board FRQs
  
The most challenging aspects of the exam were...
- Time management and trying to understand what they're asking for!! I spent most of my time reading and trying to understand examples rather than coding and that made me lose so so much time.
  
Time management techniques that worked well for me...
- I tried skipping around, doing some parts of each FRQ, especially if I was stuck on one. However, I don't think that worked well. My initial thought was to hop around and hopefully the questions later will help with previous ones, like how everything builds on top of all another, but it ended up just cluttering and confusing me even more.
  
Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions...
- I knew I wasn't going to do the best, so I tried to rack up points from what I know. The exam is made to be challenging so try to stay calm (panicking is also why I re-read the prompts like one thousand times and lost so much time) and just try out what you know. 
# Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Topic/Concept 1: ArrayLists in general. I struggled most with FRQ 3, from even creating it to accessing elements, I overall just need more help with ArrayLists.

- Topic/Concept 2: 2D arrays and accessing neighboring elements. I did struggle to remember this while taking the exam and only got so much more comfortable afterwards, so more practice would help me remember in the long term. 

- Programming practice: I just want to get to understand code better. It can over general to everything really as long as I can understand why and how something works. If I can get behind the curtains it may be helpful so I'll try to find explainations to why for questions I missed. 

# Resources

Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

- Knowt: https://knowt.com/ 
- Quizlet: https://knowt.com/ 
- Princeton Review Book: https://www.princetonreview.com/college-advice/ap-computer-science-a-exam
- College Board: https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam/past-exam-questions
  
# Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:

- Specific goal related to computer science learning: I want to understand how it works, so probably the syntax and the reason why behind it. If everything builds up like a story, it'll be easier to grasp and paint a mental picture of.
  
- Project idea inspired by the exam content: The 4th FRQ can be made into a game, almost like a deck of cards. It can be an interesting passion project if I decide to do it.
  
- Study strategy for future computer science courses: Know a bit of everything as everything builds on top of another. If you don't understand one part, ask before you're too far behind because it's not something you can sadly cram.
